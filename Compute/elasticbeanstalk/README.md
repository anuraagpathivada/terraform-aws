# Terraform Elastic Beanstalk üåê

AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) offering from Amazon Web Services (AWS) that simplifies the deployment and management of web applications. It allows developers to upload their application code and automatically handles the deployment, capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling, and health monitoring of the application environment. With Elastic Beanstalk, developers can focus on building their applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure, making it easier to deploy and manage scalable web applications on AWS.

***VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):*** The VPC provides a virtual network for the Elastic Beanstalk environment, allowing you to launch AWS resources in a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud. It includes private and public subnets distributed across multiple availability zones for high availability and fault tolerance.

***Elastic Beanstalk Application:*** The Elastic Beanstalk application is a container for the code that you want to deploy. It provides an easy-to-use interface for deploying and managing web applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

***Elastic Beanstalk Environment:*** The Elastic Beanstalk environment is where your application runs. It automatically handles the deployment, capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling, and health monitoring of your application. This environment is configured with settings such as VPC configuration, instance type, load balancer settings, and auto-scaling parameters.

***S3 Bucket:*** An S3 bucket is created to store the application code bundle that will be deployed to Elastic Beanstalk. The code bundle is uploaded to the S3 bucket, and Elastic Beanstalk retrieves it during the deployment process.

***Route 53 Record:*** A Route 53 DNS record is created to map the Elastic Beanstalk environment's URL to a domain name. This allows users to access the deployed application using a custom domain name.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

- **[Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)**: Infrastructure as Code Tool.
